## College System Assignment

**Assignment Overview:**

Create a RESTful system for managing students with CRUD operations (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE).

**Assignment Tasks:**

1. Implement four _RESTful_ endpoints for student management, following REST conventions.

2. Integrate Swagger for comprehensive API documentation using [this guide](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-rest-openapi-documentation).

3. Share your code by adding it to your GitHub repository and sending me the link to the repo via [Slack](https://fum-cs.slack.com/team/U062Y7MB1T3) or [Email](mailto:moghani.arash@gmail.com).

4. Optionally, add an [H2 database](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot-h2-database) to store student data using [JPA annotations](https://javatute.com/jpa/how-to-create-an-entity-using-spring-data-jpa/).

5. Optionally, expand the system to include "courses" and "professors" using Java data structures.
 
**Note:** You can use in-memory data structures (e.g., Java List, Set) as no database is required for this assignment.

Good luck!
