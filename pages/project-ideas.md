Students are encouraged to use their own ideas. By the way the above ideas are presented to guide and inspire choices.
It's essential that chosen projects incorporate endpoints. For instance, while a Telegram bot might lack a direct endpoint, it should ideally feature an admin control panel accessed via specific endpoints.

The main aim of the course project is to help you get comfortable with the Java programming language, learn to write clean and maintainable code, and acquire the essential skills to build a complete application. Thus, if you opt for the first topic (professor-student system) and execute it simply yet in alignment with course goals, a successful grade is assured.

Java is favored due to its strong emphasis on programming principles, especially object-oriented programming. However, using Python is also an acceptable alternative.
